## Numb Plugins
This is a collection of OldSchool RuneScape Automation plugins which I (Anarchise) created, originally designed for use with OpenOSRS client.
Some methods within these plugins are OUTDATED with most current automation clients, including our own.
With some very basic knowledge, they can be fixed and altered to fit your own needs, and our or other clients.
